# What am _I_ working on this week?

Wow, what a couple months! It's been a while since I last checked in here. [Per normal][1] life got in the way. But hey, they say you should try no matter what right? Right?

A lot has changed related to some of the projects that I have been working on. I am no longer trying to build the tablet interface for Home-Assistant. We decided that we were not planning to stay where we are long term and did not want to make changes to the house that the next owners will have to revert.

Just a quick recap of the projects and ideas that I was working on before:

## End of 2020

- ~~[x] Research suppliers on Alibaba that can manufacture a few ESP-32 based smart plugs~~

  - ~~I need to research which board type is best~~

  - ~~Initial thoughts were to use the BLE addresses of our various devices to track which room we are in at a given time and [Home-Assistant][2] would then be able to react based on this information.~~

    - ~~We are are an Apple iOS household and iOS randomizes BLE MAC addresses rendering tracking unusable. This project may be DOA.~~

    - ~~Turns out this as expected DOA. Looks like I will be dropping this project for now and just going with standard ESP-8266 based plugs~~

    - The iOS app is good enough and motion sensors _aren't too ugly and evil_ are they? Have to settle with these for now.

- [ ] ~~Move more of my [Home-Assistant][2] [config][3] to my new server~~

  - ~~In progress, check out my [git repo][3]!~~

    - ~~I need to finish sanitizing the files and push. _Soon_ I promise!~~

    - Who knows, there is a lot of cleaning and updates to be made. This is probably going to be scrapped for now. Actually, yeah, this is scrapped.

- [ ] ~~Update some of my [Home-Assistant][2] [UI][3] and start creating a _tabletized_ version to mount on the wall~~

  - ~~On hold, since I need to determine what size tablet, how many, and where and how they will be mounted~~

  - ~~I plan to create another post and link it here with the different models that I have researched~~

- [x] ~~Build out a few more of the services that I [self-host][4] on the Proxmox cluster in the colocation~~

  - ~~Priority will be [influxdb][5] and configure [Home-Assistant][2] to leverage it~~

  - ~~[Syncthing][6] and [Resilio Sync][7] are finished~~

- [ ] ~~Continue moving configuration from existing [Home-Assistant][2]~~

- [ ] ~~Research tablets for the tablet version of my [Home-Assistant][2] [UI][3]~~

  - ~~Research mounting options that allow the table to be removed easily~~

- [ ] ~~Build a [link shortener][8] for this blog~~

  - ~~[Shlink][9] looks promising after some quick research~~

---

Whew, looks like that list is just a shell of it's former self. As you can probably see, a lot of my ideas didn't work out. Not a worry though just gives me more freedom to look into other ideas! Eventually one will stick!

## This upcoming week

Probably more clean-up of this blog and closing projects out.


## But... What _am_ I working on?

### Cloudflare

Cloudflare has a new service offering (still in beta at the time of this writing) called [CloudFlare Pages][10]. According to CloudFlare

> Cloudflare Pages is a JAMstack platform for frontend developers to collaborate and deploy websites.

At a high level CloudFlare Pages is platform that empowers developers to build and deploy front end applications, or in this case a static site generated by [Hugo][11].

#### Why move from GitHub Pages?

While I did not have a compelling case to change, there was one feature that piqued my interest. [Preview Deployments][12] allow for a pull request to be opened and a preview of the site to be generated with a unique URL. Since CloudFlare already hosts this site's DNS it made sense to investigate.

This setup and workflow, I plan to document in depth as a seperate post. Right now there are a few items that need to be worked out in my workflow first.

### Kubernetes!
