# What is this?

Just like a lot of side projects they tend to get relegated to whatever free time the maintainer can set aside. Wether it be a cople minutes here and there or a dedicated day on the weekend. Today is Halloween and that means there is even less time for trial and error on these projects. I am going to try to start these posts on a semi-regular basis to hold myself accountable to making progress on tmy various projects. 

Today:

- Research suppliers on Alibaba that can manufacture a few [ESP32][1] based smart plugs

  - I also need to research which board type is best

- Move more of my [Home-Assistant][2] [config][3] to my new server

- Update some of my [Home-Assistant][2] [UI][3] and start creating a _tabletized_ version to mount on the wall
